# TicTacToe

This is an implementation for TicTacToe game using python programming language.

In this implementation I have separated the logic of the game from code for interaction with the user into two files as:
* logic.py: This class is in charge of managing the state of the game
* UI.py: This class is responsible for interacting with user and showing the UI to;

## How to run
After cloning the code, run the game by executing ```python UI.py``` command in terminal.

When you get the code the size of the board is 3 * 3, but you can edit it at line 69 in UI.py and try other sizes.
